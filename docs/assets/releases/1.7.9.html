<h3>Visual Changes</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Removed highlighted hotkeys from all ability tooltips to simplify localization.</li>
    <li>[Forward Observer] Updated Orbital Artillery effect to use projectiles instead of an explosion. Description of the ability has been updated to reflect this (kinetic projectiles fired from orbit instead of missiles).</li>

    <li>Fixed Osiris marine reaction messages not working.</li>
    <li>Reverted the change that disabled NVG in replays to prevent bugged replays (camera changes are still disabled in replays, those should be fine)</li>
