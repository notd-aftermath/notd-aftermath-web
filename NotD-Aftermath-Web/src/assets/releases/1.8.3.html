<h2>Patch details</h2>

<h3>Perks and Prestige System</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Players with the rank of General can use the new -prestige command to reset their experience to 0 and gain prestige, which grants certain unlocks (details on that below).</li>
    <li>Only the player's experience can be reset. Medal progress, MOS, Combat Readiness etc. can't be reset. Experience-related unlocks like movement speed, sidearms, class unlocks, System Purge, mini reinforcements etc. will need to be earned anew as the player goes through the ranks again.</li>
    <li>Prestige can be gained as follows: at the time you reset your experience, you gain 1 prestige for every 2 million experience. Example: If you prestige at 2 000 000 xp, you get 1 prestige; If you prestige at 4 123 456 xp, you get 2 prestige; If you prestige at 5 999 999 exp, you still get 2 prestige.</li>
    <li>This is entirely optional. The player decides if they want to do it or not.</li>
    <li>Prestige is capped at 10.</li>
    <li>Prestige is displayed on the multiboard, next to the player's experience.</li>
    <li>Each point of prestige increases your hero's base maximum energy by 2%, up to a maximum of 20%.</li>
    <li>Players with at least 1 prestige can use abilities from the new Perks menu. Higher prestige unlocks more perks, but a player can only use 1 perk per game, and that perk can only be used once. These limitations make it possible to give players new and exciting things to unlock, without making them overpowered. The Perks menu can be found inside Leadership (hotkey X).</li>
    <li>New perk: Request Pickup. Unlocked at Prestige 1. Calls in a helicopter to transport the player's units to a location of their choice. Unavailable during Black Hawk Down (BHD), Containment and Nightstalkers until the power generator is restored.</li>
    <li>New perk: Care Package. Unlocked at Prestige 1. Requests an item airdrop at the target location. The type of the item is selected from a random pool. The pools are slightly different based on hero class. Unavailable during BHD, Containment and Nightstalkers until the power generator is restored.</li>
    <li>New perk: Eye In The Sky. Unlocked at Prestige 2. Cast on an enemy unit. While the target is alive, its position will be marked with a special icon on the minimap and updated in real time. All players will see the minimap icon, but the ability does not grant vision of the target itself, like Laser Designator does. Reduces armor by 4. Can target spell-immune units. Cast range is global. Unavailable during Nightstalkers until the power generator is restored.</li>
    <li>New perk: Overcharge. Unlocked at Prestige 4. Vastly increases energy regeneration. Lasts until energy becomes full, for up to a maximum of 30 seconds.</li>
    <li>New perk: Adrenaline Rush. Unlocked at Prestige 5. Refreshes the cooldowns of all the marine’s abilities. 3 seconds casting time.</li>
    <li>New perk: Custom M9 Lights. Unlocked at Prestige 7. Basically a built-in Field Light with slightly worse true sight and sight range bonus.</li>
    <li>New perk: Rotguise. Unlocked at Prestige 8. The marine disguises himself as a zombie to make Zulus ignore him. He won't auto attack while disguised. Lasts for a maximum of 2 minutes. Attacking or damaging any unit will immediately break the marine's cover.</li>
    <li>New perk: Old War Buddy. Unlocked at Prestige 9. The player will get a random mini marine, but it will take him 10 to 15 minutes to arrive and he will only have a medkit with a single charge. Unavailable during Nightstalkers until the power generator is restored.</li>
    <li>At Prestige 10 (which is the maximum), the player can use up to 2 perks per game. But the same perk can't be used twice.</li>
    <li>If you mouse over the Perks, you will see that some of them require not only Prestige, but also Marine Command Authorization or Long Range Communications. Those are available through most of the game. Marine Command Authorization is unavailable during BHD and Containment. Long Range Communications are unavailable during Nightstalkers.</li>
    <li>The MQ-3 Predator has no access to Perks. It will spawn with a Claymore Case if the player has at least 1 Prestige. Higher prestige increases the number of Claymores in the stack.</li>
    <li>Codes generated by version 1.8.3 can't be loaded in older versions, but codes from older versions can be loaded in 1.8.3. We're not doing a code wipe.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gameplay Changes</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Improved the AI of Delta Force during the airfield defense mission so the mission can be attempted more often. SSgt. Thompson and his team now have a pivotal role there. Each turret will be defended by one of those men. If the players can keep them alive, they will provide valuable help by throwing smoke grenades at strategic locations. The reason for this change is because the mission had to be aborted more than 90% of the time because the team didn't have enough people or was missing certain classes like Assaultman, Machine Gunner etc.</li>
    <li>[Forward Observer] Illumination Rounds also provide vision for AI marines, including Golf company.</li>
    <li>The MQ-3 Predator player is no longer immune to losing combat readiness.</li>
    <li>Lightning damage will sometimes be low enough to be survivable, but will also inflict Short Circuit to marines and the MQ-3 Predator.</li>
    <li>During Chapter 3: Containment, players won't get the Total Failure ending if everyone died during the final wave, but the fuel and/or nukes mission was done successfully.</li>
    <li>Reworked the -ar command. Instead of changing the acquisition range of your hero, it does that for the first of the units you have selected, as long as the unit is owned by you. The goal is to allow the player to adjust the acquisition range of mini marines too.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Visual & Sound Changes</h3>

<ul>
    <li>New unit model for Navy Corpsman - a female marine model with special animations for her medical abilities. Created by Grey Knight.</li>
    <li>New weapon skin for Designated Marksman and corresponding mini marines. Model created by epsilon.</li>
    <li>New weapon skin for Delta Operator and delta NPCs. Model created by epsilon.</li>
    <li>New weapon skin for Machine Gunner and mini MG. Model created by epsilon.</li>
    <li>New visual effect for Laser Designator. The ability was always supposed to have a visual effect similar to its counterpart in NOTD2, but the effect was bugged. I imported a new laser visual effect for it. Effect created by Spellbound.</li>
    <li>Replaced the projectile model of TX-1 Ammunition because the old one was making the bullets invisible.</li>
    <li>The helicopters landed at the airfield won't make noise as if their engines were on.</li>
    <li>Added visual effects when item drops hit the ground.</li>
    <li>The following items now spawn via airdrop: The Moirae Shiva, the Field Lights at Power Generator during Nightstalkers, M242 chain gun components and Marking Beacons.</li>
    <li>When a unit is tagged (via control ping) as needing medical attention, repairs or ammunition, its name will be displayed in the color of the player who owns the unit.</li>
    <li>Units can't get tagged (via control ping) as low on HP if they are already being healed by a Medical Kit or Blood Transfusion.</li>
    <li>Added numbered minimap icons to Array Radar, Cocoon and TITAN Nuke pings.</li>
    <li>Lt. Oliver's weapon now shoots the same kind of bullets as the Forward Observer's.</li>
    <li>When selecting another player's M242 Chain Gun while a shared vision alliance is up, the player's resources (rounds, magazines, etc.) will no longer be shown in the unit info panel.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Quality of Life Changes</h3>

<ul>
    <li>After the player dies, their pet won't get automatically selected if the player has already selected another unit under their control (e.g. a mini marine). The pet will still spawn, it just won't get forcefully selected for the player (which could disrupt their control of the current unit they've selected). Same goes when the Communications Module spawns after the pet dies.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Aegis turrets can no longer attack after being destroyed.</li>
    <li>Fixed a visual effect that was being displayed at the wrong location during Delta airfield defense when the Black Hawks bring the pilots.</li>
    <li>If a parasite spore spawns a super parasite, it can no longer cause other spores to spawn a super parasite too.</li>
    <li>The frequency of parasite spawns from spores will scale with the number of starting players, as intended. As a result of this fix and the previous fix, spores will now spawn parasites more often but they will spawn fewer super parasites.</li>
    <li>Fixed a rare bug where convoy trucks could get stuck near the exit, unable to leave the map.</li>
    <li>Stacking grenades into a Mk 17 Battle Rifle while it's lying on the ground can no longer disable the item.</li>
    <li>The Javelin Missile System will no longer fail to hit some invisible or flying units.</li>
    <li>MOS selection is now available after the nuclear strike that happens at the end of Lost Cause if players didn't stop Golf Company in time.</li>
    <li>[Infantry Unit Leader] Fixed a bug where the IUL couldn't fully deplete the artillery shells and had to leave at least 1 remaining.</li>
    <li>[Forward Observer] The illumination effect of Illumination Rounds no longer disappears several seconds before the ability stops providing vision.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where some enemy units would idle for a few seconds after getting spawned and would occasionally try to return to their spawn location for a brief moment.</li>
    <li>Fixed a visual bug where fighter jets would freeze in place for a second just before disappearing after an air strike.</li>
    <li>Fixed bugged visual effect when delta operators bash a target.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where rank promotions wouldn't get announced if the player got promoted before wave 3.</li>
    <li>Fixed the aim of the marine with the SMAW during the Magnificent Bastards ending cinematic.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where SMAW, XML-9C Shiva and Marking Beacons couldn't directly be cast on planted explosives and spell immune units.</li>
    <li>Fixed a performance issue when someone uses the arrow keys to move while in first person mode.</li>
    <li>Some mission pings, e.g. Cocoons and TITAN Nuke pings, can no longer disappear earlier than intended.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other</h3>
