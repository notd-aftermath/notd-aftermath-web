<h2>Patch details</h2>

<h3>Gameplay Changes</h3>

<ul>
    <li>William Pierce, a familiar name from the endgame credits, finally emerges from the depths of the game files. This deadly marksman will join Golf company on Hell mode when there are 5 or more surviving players.</li>
    <li>Added an XP bonus if players clear Lost Cause with all technicians unharmed.</li>
    <li>Golf company claymores won't get triggered by technicians or blue Golf marines. Also, they won't spawn near Technicians.</li>
    <li>Killing friendly minis during Lost Cause can cause Article 15.</li>
    <li>Players can get ailments when attacked by Zulus during Lost Cause.</li>
    <li>Hits taken during Lost Cause will count.</li>
    <li>Ground Illumination Flares are invulnerable, except on Deathmatch and Lost Cause. Reduced their HP to 15. They no longer spawn a separate attackable unit for each player.</li>
    <li>Flares and Ground Illumination Flares will give vision to all AI marines, including enemy marines during Lost Cause.</li>
    <li>The Communications Array creates two-way shared vision between the players and the brown and light blue AI players but not with civilians in town or with Golf company.</li>
    <li>The Communications Array can create shared vision with the brown AI player even before the convoy mission.</li>
    <li>Squad rating gets recalculated whenever a player loads their code, picks a hero or dies.</li>
    <li>[Assaultman] Reduced the Javelin's minimum firing range from 1500 to 1000. Now it's no longer bigger than the Assaultman's sight range, which is 1100.</li>
    <li>[Assaultman] Against flying targets, the Javelin will use direct attack mode instead of top-down attack. In this mode, the missile reaches the target faster.</li>
    <li>[Combat Engineer] Reduced the mana cost of Insert Shell from 3 to 2.</li>
    <li>[Flamethrower] Reduced Burst Fire cast range.</li>
    <li>When a hero dies with an armor item or a Rusty Mining Pick, the item won't disappear. It it's a non-hero, the item will appear immediately instead of after the corpse decays.</li>
    <li>Increased the healing provided by Freedom from 35 to 60.</li>
    <li>Nanosteel Net's armor debuff will get applied when the net hits the target, not as soon as the ability is used.</li>
    <li>Moved one of the airfield watch towers and removed another.</li>
    <li>Removed a tree near the southwest cave.</li>
    <li>Killing evil dogs and evil civilians now grants hero experience, just like with all other enemies.</li>
    <li>Killing Golf company tanks and helicopters now grants more hero experience compared to killing marines (used to be less than that).</li>
    <li>Reduced the cast range of Optical Scope for mini marksman and sniper from 4000 to 3000 to match the range of the corresponding hero ability.</li>
    <li>Increased the AoE of Medusa's radiation from 600 to 1000. Now it matches the AoE of Eris' radiation.</li>
    <li>Increased the chance to get Medusa when more players are alive. Added a chance to get Medusa on Nightmare mode.</li>
    <li>Tagging (CTRL + left click) a unit that needs medical attention will make nearby brown AI medics try to help. If the unit is your own hero, a yellow exclamation mark will appear over the hero.</li>
    <li>You can no longer tag neutral units (dogs for example) for needing medical attention.</li>
    <li>Players will once again get a smaller XP reward if Prometheus is killed after Residence 41 is destroyed and there's at least 1 surviving player.</li>
    <li>The MQ-3 Predator returns to the random pool but with conditions: the player must have 1 million experience or more and there have to be at least 8 starting players.</li>
    <li>When an array radar is placed, it will take a few seconds until the Transceiver can be used on it (while the radar is connecting to the network).</li>
    <li>The Transceiver still deals AOE damage if its target died just before the EM damaged it.</li>
    <li>Reduced the Shiva's max range from 9000 to 8000.</li>
    <li>Toggle Safety works during Deathmatch.</li>

    <li>Players who leave without picking a hero can no longer increase the number of enemy spawns.</li>
    <li>The USS Independence will accept corpses for evacuation more often until it starts moving.</li>
    <li>At the start of the M242 Chain Gun mission, before the first part is dropped, Delta Force will head for the center of the map instead of a random LZ.</li>
    <li>Added some Hunter spawns to Revelation and the M242 Chain Gun mission.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Visual & Sound Changes</h3>

    <li>Players will be listed with no rank until they load their code or pick a hero (as opposed to being listed as a private).</li>
    <li>Claymore detonations can cause tinnitus.</li>
    <li>The daytime transition now always happens exactly at 6 am.</li>
    <li>Added day/night cycle to Deathmatch.</li>
    <li>Trees will shake when damaged by MD5 mines.</li>
    <li>SSgt. Thompson and his team arrive with parachutes.</li>
    <li>[Forward Observer] The marine now changes his animation slightly while channeling Orbital Artillery.</li>
    <li>[MQ-3 Predator] Adjusted the angle of the first person mode camera.</li>
    <li>You can no longer hear Bernard reload his shotgun after he uses it at the end of Intro C.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Quality of Life Changes</h3>

<ul>
    <li>New command: -target. Displays the name of the unit currently targeted by the Transceiver.</li>
    <li>Removed the -abort command. From now on all you need to do in order to select a different target for the Javelin Missile System is to use the item on the new target.</li>

    <li>First person mode can now also be toggled by pressing the ~ key.</li>
